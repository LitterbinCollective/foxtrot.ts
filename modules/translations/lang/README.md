## Tips/Guidelines
If you are planning to translate foxtrot into another language or modify
the already-made translations, please keep the following things in mind.
- Keep it as casual as possible.
- Use lowercase and be informal.
- Be nice, do not use explicit or offensive vocabulary.
- Feel free to use wordplay or puns.
- When it comes to gendered languages, use masculine gender if the part of
speech (e.g. verbs) is related to the bot.
