Folder named `lang` contains translations. Any corrections or additions
are very much appreciated!

## Tips/Guidelines
If you are planning to translate foxtrot into another language or modify
the already-made translations, please keep the following things in mind.
- Keep it as casual as possible.
- Use lowercase and be informal.
- Be nice, do not use explicit or offensive vocabulary.
- Feel free to use wordplay or puns.
- When it comes to gendered languages, use masculine gender if the part of
speech (e.g. verbs) is related to the bot.

Some additions may also be made by the maintainers. In this case, the
translations done by the said maintainers cannot be always correct and
follow the guidelines above. As said before, corrections and additions
are very much appreciated!
